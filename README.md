# STAT 550 Paper Presentation

### [<u>Link To Presentation</u>](https://hotz1.github.io/stat-550-paper-presentation/presentation.html)

This is a small GitHub Pages site I created for a paper presentation which I did for my STAT 550 course.

This presentation is primarily based on the paper [*Biostatistical concepts and methods in the legal setting*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.4780141505) by Joseph L. Gastwirth and Samuel W. Greenhouse.
