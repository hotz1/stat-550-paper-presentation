# [Legal Background]{style="color:#fafafa;"} {visibility="uncounted" background-color=#005500}

## Criminal and Civil Cases

In the U.S. Justice System, there are two forms of legal proceedings; [criminal law]{.tertiary} and [civil law]{.tertiary}.

::::: panel-tabset

### Criminal Law

:::: {style="font-size: 80%; width: 550px;"}
- The defendant is [presumed innocent until proven guilty]{.tertiary} of a criminal act.
- The burden of proof is on the prosecution to prove that the defendant is guilty [beyond a reasonable doubt]{.tertiary}.
::::
![](images/handcuffs.png){.absolute bottom=100 right=0 width=500}

### Civil Law
::: {style="font-size: 80%; width: 550px;"}
- The defendant is accused of causing harm and/or damages through their actions.
- The plaintiff must show that the defendant is *likely* liable for damages based on a "[preponderance of the evidence]{.tertiary}".
- If the defendant is found liable, the court will determine a [legal remedy]{.tertiary} to compensate for the harm to the plaintiff(s).  
:::

:::::

## Proving Discrimination 
::: {.incremental}
 - Legally, [discrimination]{.tertiary} occurs when a person is unfairly disadvantaged due to a [protected ground]{.tertiary}, such as:
     * Age
     * Sex
     * Gender identity/presentation
     * Race
 - Note: Discrimination does **not** have to be intentional. The legal definition considers impact, not intent.
 - Discrimination lawsuits are primarily handled in civil courts, where the burden of proof is a balance of probabilities.
:::

## Statistical Interpretation
::: {.incremental}
 - We can consider these discrimination lawsuits under a [hypothesis testing]{.secondary} framework.
 - The [null hypothesis]{.secondary} ($H_0$) is that there is no discrimination in the provided scenario.
     * Rejecting $H_0$ is equivalent to finding the defendant liable.
     * Failing to reject $H_0$ means that there is not sufficient enough evidence to convince the court of discrimination.

# [Employee Layoffs]{style="color:#fafafa;"} {visibility="uncounted" background-color=#005500}

## Discrimination in Employee Layoffs
::: {.incremental}
 - *Council 31 v. Ward* (1991) is a legal case from Illinois concerning a mass layoff of over 200 government employees.
 - 40.1% of the fired employees were Black, despite the fact that Black employees comprised only 34.3% of the workforce.
 - The plaintiffs argued that these layoffs discriminated against Black employees due to their race.

```{r example-1-table-1}
firing.disc.df <- data.frame("Total" = c(1512, 2900), "Fired" = c(130, 87),
                                "Retained" = c(1512 - 130, 2900 - 87), 
                                row.names = c("Black", "White"))

## Applying Relative Risk

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
::: {.fragment .fade-out fragment-index=2}
 - The standard in many discrimination cases is to examine the [relative risk]{.secondary} between the groups. 
 - Relative risk is a ratio which compares the likelihood of an event or outcome across multiple groups.

::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}
![](images/apollo-justice-discrimination.png){.absolute bottom=0 right=0 height=500}
:::

## The Odds Ratio

::: {.incremental}
 - The odds ratio is a measurement which can be used to quantify the association between a pair of events. 
 - In this situation, the [odds ratio]{.secondary} may be a better metric for assessing whether these layoffs were discriminatory towards Black employees.
 - In this legal case, the odds ratio is $\frac{130/1382}{87/2813} = 3.04$.
     * This signifies a strong association between an employee being Black and an employee being fired.
:::

## Fisher's Exact Test

::::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="60%"}
::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
 - [Fisher's Exact Test]{.secondary} is a statistical test which is used for analyzing contingency tables.
 - The test assumes that the margins of the table are fixed.
:::
::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}
 - If employees are fired "fairly" (without discrimination based on race), the odds ratio should be close to 1.
     * We can write this as a null hypothesis; $H_0: \text{OR} = 1$, with $H_A: \text{OR} \ne 1$.

## Remedying a Salary Gap

 - *EEOC* ^[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] *vs. Shelby County* (1988) is a case from Tennessee concerning unequal pay for male and female employees of the County. 
 - In this lawsuit, the [remedy]{.tertiary} was determined using statistical modelling.

## Investigating the Pay Inequality

::::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="60%"}

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
- In this lawsuit, the [disparate impact]{.tertiary} of discrimination is the difference in monthly salary between male and female employees.
:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
- [Linear regression]{.secondary} can be used to determine the significance of this difference.

  ::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
  - The [null hypothesis]{.secondary} ($H_0$) is that sex does not impact salary.
  :::
  
:::

::::

:::: {.column width="40%"}

::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}

```{r linear-regression-methods-1, comment = NA}
lm_fit_1 <- lm(Salary ~ Seniority + Sex, data = salary.df)

salary_diff_pval <- summary(lm_fit_1)$coefficients["SexM", 4]
sex_effect <- summary(lm_fit_1)$coefficients["SexM", 1]

cat(paste0("\n\n\n\n\n\n", "The p-value corresponding to the Sex variable is ", 
           signif(salary_diff_pval, 3), ".\n\n\n\n", 
           "The estimated effect of Sex on salary is $", round(sex_effect, 2), 
           " per month.", "\n\n\n\n\n\n"))

## Peters-Belson Regression
::: {.incremental}
 - Based on these outputs, it seems that the average female employee makes $`r round(sex_effect, 2)` less per month than a male employee with the same seniority level. 
 - The [legal remedy]{.tertiary} *could* be to pay each female employee $`r round(sex_effect, 2)` per month to make up the difference. 
     * However, seniority is also linearly correlated with the monthly salary.
 - [Peters-Belsen regression]{.secondary} estimates the salary which each female employee would have earned, if they were paid like male employees.
     * The legal remedy for each female employee is the difference between the earned salary and their deserved salary.

## Peters-Belson Regression
```{r peters-belson-regression, fig.width=11, fig.height=10}
lm_fit_2 <- lm(Salary ~ Seniority, data = salary.df, 
               subset = salary.df$Sex == "M")
male_fit_coefs <- unname(lm_fit_2$coefficients)

salary.df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Seniority, y = Salary, color = Sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Seniority (Months)", y = "Monthly Salary (USD)", 
       title = paste0("Monthly Salary and seniority of 23 clerical employees in the",

## Key Messages{style="font-size: 80%;"}
::: {.incremental}
 - Statistical methods and models are highly applicable in legal cases, particularly in civil lawsuits.
 - We can view these civil lawsuits using a [hypothesis test]{.secondary}.
 - [Fisher's Exact Test]{.secondary} can determine if there is a disparate impact between groups.
     * The null hypothesis ($H_0$) is that there is no disparate impact; the odds ratio is 1.
     * Fisher's Exact Test is best for 2x2 contingency tables, but it still works for larger tables.
 - We can use [Peters-Belson regression]{.secondary} to determine the legal remedy for a disparate impact in salary or payment.
     * PB regression is fitted based only on the values from the non-impacted group.
     * The estimated outcomes from PB regression represent the expected salary of someone who is not discriminated against.
     * The legal remedy ensures that all employees are paid as if they are members of the "majority group".
